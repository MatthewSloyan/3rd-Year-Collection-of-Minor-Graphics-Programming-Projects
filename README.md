## Graphics Programming Module Minor Projects
This repository contains a collection of small projects using various technologies and languages which are outlined below in more detail.

## 1: Python
#### OpenCV, NumPy and Matplotlib
We we given a variety of test tasks using Python libraries. 
* Corner detection on images using Harris, Shi Tomasi and SIFT Corner Detection algorithms.
* Draw Matches to compare two images.
* Matplotlib to visually display all images.

## 2: HTML and JavaScript
#### HTML Canvas
Using HTML and JavaScript we were tasked with creating a realistic physics similation between multiple bouncing balls. 
The balls could also rotate, teleport and. I included extras such as adding multiple colliding balls, turning on/off gravity etc.
It can be tested by opening the HTML file in a browser.

#### D3.js
We had to create a interactive graph that reads from JSON file. It uses the JavaScript library [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

#### Three.js, 
We had to create a 3D scene that the user could view a bouncing ball with colliders, shadows and move around in a 3D space.
It uses the JavaScript library [Three.jss](https://threejs.org/)

## 3: C#
#### Unity game development
We we tasked with making a basic unity game and writing scripts with assets from the Unity store. I decided to create a first person
forklift driving game which allows the player to look around, control the forklift and lift objects in a 3D space.
